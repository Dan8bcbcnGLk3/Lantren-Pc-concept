# Lantern-PC

Lantern-PC is an innovative computer project that replaces a traditional screen with a high-speed RGB LED lantern grid.  
It achieves ultra-high frame rates (over 100,000 FPS) and near-zero latency, creating a smooth and futuristic visual experience.

## Features

- Uses hundreds of addressable RGB LED lanterns as pixels
- Controlled by an FPGA for extremely fast updates
- Achieves refresh rates beyond conventional monitors
- Ultra-low latency input-to-display response
- Runs standard PC software (Windows, games) through a custom rendering pipeline
- Optional surround sound and startup animations
