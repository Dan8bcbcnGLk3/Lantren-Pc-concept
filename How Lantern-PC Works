Lantern-PC is a breakthrough display technology that replaces traditional monitors with a custom grid of RGB LED lanterns controlled by an FPGA and CPU. It achieves ultra-high frame rates (100,000+ FPS) and near-zero input latency using parallel hardware and custom software.

ðŸ”· System Overview
Rendering the Image

The CPU renders frames just like a regular PC â€” calculating the color (RGB) for each pixel in the image.

These RGB values (24-bit: 8 bits per Red, Green, Blue) are stored in system memory as a frame buffer.

Data Transfer to FPGA

Instead of sending the image to a GPU/monitor, the frame is sent to a fast, programmable FPGA chip.

The FPGA reads the RGB data and prepares it for output.

Parallel Output to Lanterns

The FPGA uses multiple parallel SPI lanes (30â€“40 MHz or more) to send RGB data directly to thousands of micro RGB lanterns.

All lanterns update in perfect sync using shared latch/clock signals.

Each lantern lights up with its assigned RGB value, forming a real-time image.

High FPS Display

The lanterns can update at over 100,000 frames per second, much faster than any traditional screen.

The result is ultra-smooth motion with almost zero blur or delay.

Low-Latency Input

Custom keyboard and mouse hardware operate at 100,000 Hz polling rate, directly connected to the FPGA.

Inputs are processed instantly (in ~10â€“20Âµs), bypassing OS/USB bottlenecks.

This makes Lantern-PC ideal for gaming, simulation, and real-time control.

Power Efficiency

Power usage is mostly determined by brightness, not frame rate.

~7.5W at 25% brightness

~15W at 50% brightness

~30W at 100% brightness

FPGA power adds ~3â€“7W depending on workload.

Rendering Approach

Lantern-PC uses efficient software rendering with flat shading and fixed-point math.

No traditional GPU is required â€” 3D and 2D images can be rendered by the CPU and/or FPGA logic.

âœ… Summary
The CPU renders the image â†’ stores it as RGB in memory â†’ sends it to the FPGA â†’ FPGA updates all lanterns in parallel â†’ lanterns display the image in real-time.

Input devices also connect directly to the FPGA â†’ enabling instant reaction at 100,000 Hz.

The result: a fast, smooth, modular display system with massive potential beyond traditional screens.
