To build your own Lantern-PC, follow these basic steps:

1. **Get the LED Lanterns**  
   Acquire addressable RGB LED modules such as SK9822 or LPD8806. Arrange them into a physical grid that will act as the display.

2. **Set up the Controller**  
   Use an FPGA development board to drive the LED lanterns. Program the FPGA to send data signals at very high speed (100,000+ updates per second) via SPI or similar protocols.

3. **Prepare the PC Hardware**  
   Use a small form-factor PC (like Mini-ITX) running Windows or Linux to handle software, input, and game processing.

4. **Connect Input Devices**  
   Use ultra-high polling rate mouse and keyboard (100,000 Hz) connected to the PC for low-latency control.

5. **Wire Everything**  
   Connect the FPGA controller to the LED grid with proper wiring, including short cables, resistors, and shared latch signals for synchronization.

6. **Develop or Use Software**  
   Run custom rendering software that converts game frames or UI elements into LED color data and sends it to the FPGA controller.

7. **Power the System**  
   Provide adequate power for the PC, FPGA, and LED lanterns (power consumption depends mainly on LED brightness).
